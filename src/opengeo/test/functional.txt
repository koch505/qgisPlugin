	-with "delete resource" layer, check that it also deletes the resource
-Modify layer info using the description panel
	-modify abstract
	-modify title
	-modify SRS
-Add layer to QGIS project
	- Both for raster and vector layers
	- Both using the context menu action and dragging and dropping on the QGIS canvas

GROUPS

	-check that it shows error on message bar if name is empty

-Remove layer from group
-Check that layer cannot be removed from group when only the group only contains one layer (cannot create empty group)
-Change rendering order (up/down/to top/to bottom)

-Edit group by dragging a layer item on a layer item under a group item (should add it to the parent group of the layer item)
	

STYLES
-Import style from style
	-check that no style is imported if clicking cancel on dialog
	-check that it uses QGIS layer name when name box is left empty
	-check that it uses entered name when name box is not empty	
-Import style by dragging a QGIS style item
-Clean (remove unused styles):
	-Import a layer. It will create a style and a layer
	-Delete the layer, making sure that the option to delete the layer style is not enabled. That will leave an unused style
	-Run the "Clean (remove unused styles)" option. That should delete the style	
-Consolidate styles
