GEOSERVER

CATALOG
-Connect to catalog
-Connect to catalog with wrong url or credentials: should show "could not connect to catalog" message in message bar
-Check connections are persisted if corresponding option is enabled
-Connect to previous workspace that is not enabled (icon is grayed-out)
Check that clicking on the catalog item displays catalog info in the description panel
-Remove catalog:
	-Check it removes it from the tree 
	-Check that, when reopening the explorer, it is not in the list of previous catalogs
	-Check that, once deleted, the description panel is not available and the buttons corresponding to the dialog are not present in the toolbar 
-Dragging a layer from the QGIS browser into a catalog item should add the resource to the workspace and create a layer that publishes it

WORKSPACE
-Create new workspace
-Create new worskpace with existing name: should show error message in message bar
-Create new worskpace with wrong/missing uri: should show error message in message bar
-Set workspace as default.
-Check that "set as default workspace" is disabled for the current default workspace
-Delete non-empty workspace: 
	- Delete empty with all its datastores not used by any layer. It should be deleted without warning
	- Delete empty with at least a datastore used by a layer. It should show warning and clicking on ok should delete the workspace and the dependent layers
-Delete empty workspace
-Delete datastore that is used in a layer. 
	-It should show a confirmation dialog saying that the layer will also be deleted. 
	-Accept and check that both elements are deleted 
-Clean (remove unused stores) workspace:
	-Import a layer. It will create a store and a layer
	-Delete the layer, making sure that the option to delete the underlying resource is not enabled. That will leave an unused resource
	-Run the "Clean (remove unused elements)" option. That should delete the resource
-Dragging a layer from the QGIS browser into a workspace item should add the resource to the workspace and create a layer that publishes it

LAYER
-Add style to layer
-Add style to layer indicating that it should be considered as the default style
-Make style default
-Add style to layer dragging style item
-Remove style from layer
-Check that default style cannot be removed from layer (option should be disabled) 
-Delete layer
	-with "delete style" option enabled, check that the style is deleted if and only if no other layer uses that layer
	-with "delete resource" layer, check that it also deletes the resource
-Modify layer info using the description panel
	-modify abstract
	-modify title
	-modify SRS
-Add layer to QGIS project
	- Both for raster and vector layers
	- Both using the context menu action and dragging and dropping on the QGIS canvas
-Dragging a layer from the QGIS browser into a layer item should add the resource to the default workspace and create a layer that publishes it
-Dragging into the "GeoServer Layers" item should do the same.

GROUPS
-Create group by selecting several layers, right-clicking and using "create group"
	-check that it shows error on message bar if name is empty
-Create group by using the "new group" option in the groups item
	-check that it shows error on message bar if name is empty
	-check that it shows error on message bar if no layer is selected (empty group)
	-check that no group is created if clicked on "cancel"
	-check that "(de)select option works fine"
	-check that when the dialog is opened layers have their default style selected
-Delete group.
-Delete layer that is used in a group. 
	-It should show a confirmation dialog saying that the group will also be deleted. 
	-Accept and check that both elements are deleted
-Edit group:
	-check that previous layers are in the group definition	
	-check that group layers have the corresponding style and that style is saved when closing
	-check that non-group layers have their default style selected
	-check that group is modified when closing
	-check that group is not modified if clicking "cancel"
-Remove layer from group
-Check that layer cannot be removed from group when only the group only contains one layer (cannot create empty group)
-Change rendering order (up/down/to top/to bottom)
-Edit group by dragging a layer item on group item
-Edit group by dragging a layer item on a layer item under a group item (should add it to the parent group of the layer item)
	

STYLES
-Import style from style
	-check that no style is imported if clicking cancel on dialog
	-check that it uses QGIS layer name when name box is left empty
	-check that it uses entered name when name box is not empty	
-Import style by dragging a QGIS style item
-Clean (remove unused styles):
	-Import a layer. It will create a style and a layer
	-Delete the layer, making sure that the option to delete the layer style is not enabled. That will leave an unused style
	-Run the "Clean (remove unused styles)" option. That should delete the style	
-Consolidate styles
	-Import several layers with the same style
	-Run "consolidate styles". It should leave only the first of those styles, delete the other ones, and use that first one in the layers that used the remaining ones
-Edit style: Set the "prompt for CRS" option in the Options.../CRS group. When editing a stlye, it should not ask for the CRS but go directly to the styling dialog
-Edit SLD
-Delete style.
	-If style is used by layer, it should ask for confirmation and warn that the layer will also be deleted. Check that all layers using the style are deleted


	
QGIS PROJECT

LAYERS
-Drag layer to Geoserver  catalog/workspaces item/individual workspace/layers item
-Drag layer to postgis connection and postgis schema
 
-Publish to GeoServer
	-Check that no action is performed if "cancel" is selected
-Create store form layer
	-Check that no action is performed if "cancel" is selected
